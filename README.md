# Cyber Lab Journal

This repository serves as my primary operational log for hands-on cybersecurity training. It documents my progression through blue team detection, red team simulation, and real-world incident response concepts using structured, evidence-based methodology.

My background in clinical care taught me to work under pressure, document precisely, and think in timelines. This journal applies those same principles to cybersecurity operations, where evidence integrity, accuracy, and response speed are critical.

## Objectives

- Build consistent SOC-level investigative habits  
- Develop hybrid Red + Blue operational awareness  
- Strengthen detection logic and response workflows  
- Practice accurate documentation and timeline reconstruction  
- Learn through controlled failure and correction  

---

## Scope of Work

This journal includes hands-on work in:

- Network traffic analysis (PCAP review, DNS, TCP/IP behavior)
- Host-based investigation (logs, persistence, process activity)
- Adversary simulation (controlled attacks in lab environments)
- Detection engineering (rule development and tuning)
- Incident response simulation (timeline, containment, reporting)
- Privacy and OPSEC validation

## Weekly Structure

Each week follows the same professional structure:

- Objectives and learning goals  
- Tools used  
- Daily operational notes  
- Findings and anomalies  
- Mistakes and corrections  
- Lessons learned  
- Next-step improvements  

---

## Documentation Standards

- All logs are sanitized and redacted where necessary  
- No real credentials, live malware, or illegal material are stored  
- Screenshots, diagrams, and packet captures are used when appropriate  
- Each entry focuses on **decision-making**, not just tools  

---

## Operating Principles

- Learn by breaking safely  
- Defend first, attack second  
- Evidence over assumptions  
- Reduce false positives  
- Document everything  
- Respect chain-of-custody logic

## Disclaimer

All activity documented in this repository occurs in isolated lab environments or controlled simulation settings. No production systems, unauthorized networks, or real users are targeted.

This repository exists solely for educational and defensive security research purposes.

## Status

This journal is actively maintained and updated on a weekly operational cycle.
